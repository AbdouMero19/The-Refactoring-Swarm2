# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s).
# C0114: Missing module docstring (We don't care about top-level docs for small scripts)
# C0115: Missing class docstring (Let the LLM decide if it's complex enough)
# C0116: Missing function docstring (Same)
# C0301: Line too long (Modern screens are wide, 125 chars is fine)
# C0303: Trailing whitespace (Black fixes this automatically!)
# C0304: Final newline missing (Black fixes this automatically!)
# W0611: Unused import (KEEP THIS ON - The Fixer should remove these!)
